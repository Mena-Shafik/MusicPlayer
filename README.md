## About

MusicPlayer is a minimal-effort music playback application.  
It provides a clean, no-frills interface to play audio files, helping users quickly listen to their music without the overhead of a full-blown media suite.

## Features

- Play audio tracks (e.g. MP3s — depending on your implementation)  
- Basic playback controls: play, pause, skip, stop (tbd)  
- Easy drag & drop or file-open support (if implemented)  
- Simple, intuitive UI thanks to Kotlin + Gradle  

*(You can expand this list depending on your current and planned features.)*

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- JDK 8 or newer (or the version your project targets)  
- Gradle (or use the included Gradle wrapper)  
- An operating system that supports the required audio-playback libraries  

## Installation / Build
